The current code for my own personal site. Written in Django the site runs off a SQLite database for simplicity and
due to the low load it is a quick and easy method to publish.

The site was developed in mid 2016 and went live Wednesday August 17 2016.

The site features a fully featured blog that uses mark-up to display the posts style. The site uses Djangos security methods
built in and has the ability for the user to login to use full CRUD operations on the blog posts.

This is my first attempt at a database driven website and has some bugs and is generally suboptimul. I am currently
in the process of a redesign to implement some of the new knowledge I have aquired and hope to get my new site up before
the end of 2017.
