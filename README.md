The current code for my own personal site. Written in Django the site runs off a SQLite database for simplicity and
due to the low load it is a quick and easy method to publish.

The site was developed in mid 2016 and went live Wednesday August 17 2016.

This is my first attempt at a database driven website and has some bugs and is generally suboptimul. I am currently
in the process of a redesign to implement some of the new knowledge I have aquired and hope to get my new site up before
the end of 2017.
